[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/grommett/functional-lib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/grommett/functional-lib)&nbsp;[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/grommett/functional-lib/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/grommett/functional-lib?branch=master)


This code is, for the most part, taken from code written in the **excellent** book _[Functional Programming in JavaScript](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-javascript)_ by Luis Atencio. The only difference is that I've used prototypes instead of classes and written tests.

These were a fun exercise. It's one thing to read and understand, but by actually coding it up _**and**_ testing I was able to get a better grasp of the concepts.
